Summary
-------

Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a freshly-minted full-stack developer with a HUGE pile of enthusiasm to learn. Ever since my first PC I've loved troubleshooting (and made a little money doing it around the neghbourhood in my teens). While I ended up studying science rather than computer science and branched into people-facing roles, my affinity and enthusiasm for tech never went away. I LOVE figuring stuff out. When a system is put in front of me - a new codebase, a building diagram, a boardgame I haven't played - I want to experience and understand as much of it as possible. 

Skills
------

**Languages**: Javascript, Ruby, HTML, CSS      
**Frameworks, Libraries and Environments**;  ReactJS,  Rails, NodeJS, Ajax, Express, EJS, JQuery, SASS, Styled Components, Bootstrap   
**Systems, CMS and Databases**: SQL, PostgreSQL, CircleCI, Git, Heroku, Netlify      
**Testing**: Mocha, Chai, Storybook, Jest, Cypress


Projects
--------

[**Rental Rants**](https://github.com/danuhnder/lighthouse_final): A full-stack single-page web application built atop the Google Maps API. Allows users to create and view tenancy reviews linked to properties and neighbourhoods based on latitude and logitude coordinates. Built as a group final project in Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp (Dec 2020). [Check out the deployment here](https://thirsty-jang-ea95c4.netlify.app).

[**Rescue Dog Moms**](https://www.rescuedogmoms.ca): Podcast front page built with ReactJS accessing the Buzzsprout API. I built this website from client specifications and handled deployment and hosting (on time, under budget). 

[**Superfun Poll App**](https://github.com/gybubest/midterm): Allows creation of and voting on polls, with results generated using the [*Borda count*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) method.
