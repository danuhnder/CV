Summary
-------

Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a freshly-minted full-stack developer with a HUGE pile of enthusiasm to learn. I had a cute side gig as the neighbourhood's PC troubleshooter when I was in my teens, decided I 'didn't want to be a computer person' and wandered in the wilderness for a couple of decades. Now I'm back (from outer space) and have realised this is a great place to put my passion. 
I LOVE figuring stuff out. When a system is put in front of me - a new codebase, a building diagram, a boardgame I haven't played - I want to experience and understand as much of it as possible. And then I want to engage with my peers re: the system, to help clarify my understanding AND to help interpret for others who aren't at the same stage of understanding. And then I want to improve it!   
Through my previous experience I've built a skill stack that I know is useful - I'm an excellent troubleshooter, have well practised communication and customer service skills (I do have to tone my accent back sometimes), and a demonstrated ability to work like a demon during crunch times. I'm in search of an environment that also values those skills and will keep challenging and supporting me.
